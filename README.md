# Fox Game

Inspired by Brian Holt's Frontend Masters course, this is a revival of the good old Tamagotchi.

To start the game, click on the round middle button. Use the left and right arrows to toggle between the three icons to feed the fox, clean up its mess or to toggle the weather from sunshine to rain.
